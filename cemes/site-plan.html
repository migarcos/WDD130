        What Is a Sealant? Sealants are used for a variety of applications in the building, construction, and remodelling industries. Most notably, sealants such as polyurethane, silicone, acrylic, and polymer are used as grouting and insulating materials that fill gaps and waterproof structures to prevent damages such as cracks and leaks.
As a form of insulation, sealants also prevent air flow through building joints (e.g., windows and door frames) to regulate temperatures inside structures. Typically, sealants also have a certain amount of flexibility to allow for some structural movement and prevent damages.
In addition to serving a practical purpose, gap sealants also add to the aesthetic appeal of a structure by hiding minor imperfections that occur during the construction process. Sealant is an inexpensive and easy to apply solution that can boost the functionality and aesthetic of any structure while adding long-term value and stability.

What Is a Polyurethane Sealant?
There are different configurations of polyurethane sealants that are currently available on the market. Each one is appropriate for various uses and applications, so always be sure to read the label carefully.
With the accelerated upgrading of the construction industry, prefabricated buildings have shown a rapid development trend in recent years. As the first line of defense for external wall panel joint waterproofing, the performance of prefabricated building sealants is directly related to the waterproof effect of the project and it has attracted more and more attention.
There are many types of construction sealants on the market, according to the different basic polymers, they can be roughly divided into: silicone sealant (SR), polyurethane sealant (PU), and silane-modified polyether rubber (MS polyurethane sealers).
Here is another article about MS sealant, browse it if you want to learn more about MS silicone sealant How much do you know about the properties of MS sealant?
Here we are talking about silicone sealant VS PU sealant. Let's go though it.
What is polyurethane sealant?
Polyurethane sealant (Pu sealant) is mainly composed of polyurethane rubber and polyurethane prepolymer.
Polyurethane sealants are generally divided into two basic types, one-component and two-component
One-component Pu sealer is moisture curing type, the one-component Pu sealer is convenient for construction, but curing is slower.
Two-component Pu sealant is reaction curing type.; the two-component Pu sealant has the characteristics of fast curing and good performance, but it needs to be formulated during use, and the process is more complicated.
 


Pu sealant:

    The connection of prefabricated concrete and other building materials and the filling and sealing of construction joints.
    The sealing and caulking between the wooden frames of doors and windows and the concrete of the walls
    The adhesive caulking of lightweight structures (such as curtain walls) on buildings
    Waterproof caulking of facilities like balconies, swimming pools, and bathrooms
    Sealing of air-conditioning and other system connections
    Sealing of heat-insulating double-glazing and heat-insulating window frames, etc.
    Sealing of automobile windows, bonding of auto parts, etc.

The main use of polyurethane sealant is in civil engineering and transportation, so it has some famous names: polyurethane joint sealant, pu exterior sealer, polyurethane concrete sealer, polyurethane adhesive, polyurethane caulk for windows, polyurethane caulk for concrete, exterior polyurethane caulk, polyurethane adhesive sealant etc.

Silicone sealant：
Silicone sealant contains both organic groups and inorganic Si-O structurehas which makes it has the stable chemical properties of both inorganic and organic materials, especially in the performance of excellent UV resistance, heat resistance and aging resistance. Silicone sealant has good compatibility with silicone structural sealant, and is widely used in weather-resistant sealing of building curtain walls.
With the rapid development of the building curtain wall industry, the special sealant for large plate glass and the special sealant for point curtain wall have also come to the fore.

Every adhesive is not flawless and has small drawbacks. For example, the puncture resistance of silicone sealant is not particularly good, and the price is relatively expensive.
The curing speed of polyurethane sealant is a bit slow, and the aging resistance is not very good.
The advantages and disadvantages of pu adhesive and silicone sealant are different, and the apply environment is different.

In your purchase process, not only the advantages of the sealant, but also the disadvantages must be considered. Integrate the advantages and disadvantages together, and see how cost-effective is and in which place it can be used. If you only consider the advantages and ignore the disadvantages, you may encounter trouble in use. Be prepared to avoid difficult problems.

      <p>
        There are many types of construction sealants on the market, according to the different basic polymers, they can be roughly divided into: silicone sealant (SR), polyurethane sealant (PU), and silane-modified polyether rubber (MS polyurethane sealers).  
        Types of Sealants: Hybrid Polymer Sealants This is an arbitrary term that refers to essentially any combination of sealants that have different chemical compounds. MS polymers are the most commonly used hybrid polymer sealants currently on the market.
Acrylic Sealants: Before the invention of silicone sealants, acrylic was the sealing material of choice for many building industry experts. Acrylic is more affordable and durable than silicone in many regards and can be used in a wide range of applications.
Silicone Sealants: Silicone is a synthetic material that’s suited for both indoor and outdoor use. It’s highly resistant to the UV rays of the sun and can withstand hours of exposure to direct sunlight without deteriorating.
Polyurethane Sealants: Polyurethane sealant is the product of the reaction of two organic compounds, glycol and an isocyanate.

      <h3>Silicone vs PU</h3>
      <p>
        Advantage of Pu sealant
    Excellent Abrasion resistance
    High stability, wide adjustable range of performance
    Good adhesion, good strength, and tear resistance
    Good elasticity, excellent recovery, suitable for dynamic joints
    Strong anti-aging properties, service life up to 15 ~20 years
    Excellent oil resistance
    Resistance to biological aging;
    Polyurethane sealant price is moderate
    Cold resistance, good flexibility under low temperature conditions, Pu sealant will not freeze and crack in a cold environment
    Paintable
    Wide bonding range


Disadvantage of Pu sealant
1. Poor weather resistance (compared with silicone sealant) Polyurethane caulk is not heat resistant and cannot be kept in a high temperature environment for a long time, if urethane caulk is exposed to ultraviolet rays for a long time, it will accelerate the aging of the polyurethane sealant even cracks, bubbles and other conditions occurrence
2. When using polyurethane sealant in some occasions, primer is required and cannot be applied directly.
3. Polyurethane sealant is also relatively poor in water resistance, especially alkali resistance. If it is in an alkaline water environment, it will greatly affect the use effect.
4. Bubbles may appear that caused cracks in the adhesive layer during the curing process

Modified Polyurethane Sealant is neutral curing polyurethane sealant. It is safe and environment friendly with good weatherproofing ability. It shows good adhesion to concrete, aluminum, glass, and stone materials.
What is silicone sealant?
Silicone sealant (SR) is based on polydimethoxysiloxane as the main raw material, it is formed by curing elastic silicone rubber at room temperature
Silicone sealant can be divided into by its purposes: weathering sealant, structural adhesive, ordinary silicone sealant (MS sealant), special sealant (firestop sealant) , hole filling sealant (PU foam).
We have written an article about Structural sealant vs weather sealant
 
Advantage of silicone sealant

    Strong adhesion and high tensile strength
    Weather resistance, vibration resistance, moisture resistance, UV resistance and adaptability to large changes in cold and heat
    Broad applicability
    It can realize the bonding between most building materials
    Anti-aging
    No bubbles during cure

Disadvantage of silicone sealant

    Unpaintable
    Price is relatively high
